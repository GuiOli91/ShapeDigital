# ShapeDigital - Hard skill test | Data Engineer

## Introduction

This project aims to show some of my skills to Shape Digital for the position of Data Engineer, by answering the following questions from the dataset in January 2020:

1. Total equipment failures that happened?

2. Which equipment code had the most failures?

3. Average amount of failures across equipment group, ordered by the number of failures in ascending order?

***This project was implemented in python in a jupyter notebook.***
